# AI-based-starling-detection-ANN-model
This is an ANN model created to detect and repel starlings.

Repelling the birds based on acoustical detection is an efficient
method, although it can be disrupted by e.g. sounds of loud motors of cars passing or
by other birds. This project is created in order to effectively protect ripe fruits growing
on vineyards using remotely controlled sound contraption.
